# Affine Cipher
This utility is used to simulate the Affine cipher.

## About 
The Affine cipher is an algorithm that works to conceal message identity by substituting the characters in the message for other characters. This is implemented through a modular system, producing an encoded message that alters the state of the plaintext units and not their positions.

Here we will study the implementation of the Affine cipher. Create a table with two rows; one containing the letters of the alphabet, and the other containing incremental numbers from 0 to 25...
