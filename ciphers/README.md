# Ciphers

Various encryption algorithms created for machines on the TC Network.

## Software Requirements

The open-source frameworks below were used to implement these encryption algorithms. Using different versions may not provide the same results. 

```
    - GCC 6.3.0
    - G++ 6.3.0
```

## Available Algorithms

This repository will have the following encryption algorithms:

1. Caesar cipher
2. Transposition cipher
3. Vernam cipher
4. Vigenere cipher

## Cipher Features

The encryption algorithms in this repository will have the following features:

### 1. Plaintext Validation
- This feature only accepts plaintext containing specific characters.
- NO SPACES 

### 2. Cipher key validation
- This feature only accepts cipher keys containing specific characters.
- NO SPACES 

### 3. Output stream
- This feature returns the plaintext/ciphertext on the console.
